# PyDiscreteMath

This repository was created to store algorithms for solving problems in discrete mathematics in a programming language (in this case Python) during the IoT course in LPNU.



## Algorithm 1.10 (Generating all sequences in antilexicographic order)

> Data: n
> 
> Result: A sequence of permutations of the set {1,...,n} in antilexicographic order.

## Algorithm 1.19 (Generation of all partitions of the set {1, 2, . . . , n})

> Data: n
> 
> Result: The sequence of all partitions of the set {1, . . . , n}, in which each next partition is formed from the previous one by transferring a single element to another block.

## Algorithm 1.22 (Finding all partitions of a number)

> Data: n.
>
> Result: a sequence of partitions of the number n in the reverse order of the lexicographic
